// A curried function is a function which takes multiple parameters one at a time, by taking the first argument, and returning a series of functions which each take the next argument until all the parameters have been fixed, and the function application can complete, at which point, the resulting value is returned.
// A partial application is a function which has already been applied to some â€” but not yet all â€” of its arguments. The arguments which the function has already been applied to are called fixed parameters.
// Point-free style is a way of defining a function without reference to its arguments. Generally, a point-free function is created by calling a function which returns a function, such as a curried function.
// Curried functions are great for function composition, because they allow you to easily convert an n-ary function into the unary function form needed for function composition pipelines: Functions in a pipeline must expect exactly one argument.
// Data last functions are convenient for function composition, because they can be easily used in point-free style.
